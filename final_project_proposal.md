**Motivation for this project**: We are curious about the trend of HIV
diagnosis in NYC from 2010 to 2017, and whether the condom availability
program in 2018 satisfy the need of condoms in boroughs with high HIV
incidences.

**The intended final products**: We intend to create a webpage
containing an overview of the project scope, data, approaches,
visualizations, and full report. We plan to contain a dashboard in our
webpage.

**The anticipated data sources**: We used data from the following
datasets in NYC OpenData:

  - *HIV/AIDS Diagnoses by Neighborhood, Sex, and Race/Ethnicity* These
    data were reported to the NYC DOHMH by June 30, 2014. This dataset
    includes data on new diagnoses of HIV and AIDS in NYC for the
    calendar years 2010 through 2013. Reported cases and case rates (per
    100,000 population) are stratified by age group, race/ethnicity, and
    United Hospital Fund (UHF) neighborhood.

  - *HIV Testing Locations* Location and facility information for places
    in New York City that provide HIV testing.

  - *HIV/AIDS Annual Surveillance Statistics* Annual data are provided
    on new diagnoses of HIV (non-AIDS), concurrent HIV/AIDS and AIDS, as
    well as the number of persons living with HIV and AIDS and the
    number of deaths among persons with HIV and AIDS. The data are shown
    for New York City overall and by sex, race, age, borough, area-based
    poverty level, risk factor, and United Hospital Fund neighborhood.

**The planned analyses / visualizations/ coding challenge**

  - HIV trend and HIV prevalence vs. economic indicator will be
    displayed using ggplotly.
  - Summarized characteristic of infected population will be displayed
    in table.
  - Map program facility distribution vs HIV incidence to evaluate the
    efficiency of Condom availability program.
  - We might encounter coding challenges including mapping the
    distribution of program locations and HIV incidence.

**The planned timeline**

  - November 10-13: Zoom meeting –\> December 5: project report, webpage
    and screencast (video), peer assessment –\> December 10: in class
    presentation
